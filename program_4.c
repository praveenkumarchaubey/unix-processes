/* Write a program that uses an "exec()" system call to execute a program given to it through command line.
 * For example if the name of your executable is "myexecutable" then if you invoke as follows: "myexecutable mycmd a b" then "mycmd" will be executed with command line parameters "a" & "b" by the program "myexecutable".
 * (Note: "mycmd" may be any standard unix program or a program created by you)*/
